# Restaurant Journal

## Restaurant Experience Recording Application

### Goals and Interest
The goal of this application is to provide a space 
where users can easily record their restaurant experiences.
This journal can then be referenced to, for example, when
deciding which restaurant to go to for a given occasion. The
application is meant to be used by **anybody** looking to keep track
of restaurants, cafes, etc. Possible features of this application 
include entering personal ratings, cuisine, occasion the establishment
is suited for, location, and if the establishment is 
accessible by transit. Additional features may include a ranking
system based on selected features, or perhaps a chart/graph to
categorize restaurants.

A project surrounding restaurant experience is inspired by a goal
my friends and I had set for ourselves when we lived in the same
city. We decided we would try to eat at all the restaurants 
in our small city at least once. Ultimately, our goal was to
experience of our city *through* its food. A tracking application 
would have been an interesting tool to assist us in this journey.
